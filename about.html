        <h3><strong>Hi, I am Anand</strong></h3>
        <!-- <img src="/assets/images/anand.png"> -->

        <p>
            I am design technologist with experience in designing and building for the web, mobile, and smart devices. Previously, I worked at <a href="https://frappe.io/about" target="_blank">Frapp√©</a> and we made <a href="https://github.com/frappe/erpnext" target="_blank">ERPNext</a>, one of the best open source ERPs that exists today. I wore many hats: that of system administrator, developer, designer, debugger, mentor and trainer. Over the years, I became passionate about user experience and interaction design. So, I decided to go back to school and learn more about it. Currently, I am a graduate student at the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/academics/msi/human-computer-interaction-hci" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            Over a year into the program, I have:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    learned and practiced various <strong>user research methods</strong> like contextual inquiry, surveys, usability testing, diary studies, cultural probes, and user enactments
                </li>
                <li>
                    gained a general understanding of how <strong>human behavior</strong> affects user experience
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>designed and prototyped</strong> touch interactive applications
                </li>
                <li>
                    explored <strong>interactions</strong> using acoustic, inertial and visual motion tracking
                </li>
                <li>
                    worked on a number of projects in <strong>visual design</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    ideated, designed, prototyped, and demonstrated a <strong>smart wearable device</strong> within 13 weeks
                </li>
                <li>
                    prototyped a layered <strong>augmented-reality</strong> system
                </li>
                <li>
                    architected and developed a <strong>social computing</strong> application
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            I will be graduating in April 2018, and currently seeking full-time opportunities in UX Design / Prototyping.
