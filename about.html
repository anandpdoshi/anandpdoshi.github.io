            <p>
                I am an upcoming design technologist and a graduate student at the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/academics/msi/human-computer-interaction-hci" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a>. Previously, I worked at <a href="https://frappe.io/about" target="_blank">Frapp√©</a> and we made <a href="https://github.com/frappe/erpnext" target="_blank">ERPNext</a>, one of the best open source ERPs that exists today. Here, I wore many hats: that of system administrator, developer, designer, debugger, mentor and trainer. Over the years, I became passionate about user experience and interaction design. So, I decided to go back to school and learn more about it.
