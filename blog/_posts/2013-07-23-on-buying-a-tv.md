title: On buying a TV
---

My previous TV was a 21" Philips PowerVision CRT model that didn't even have a flat screen. Yet, it produced sharp images with good contrast and brightness. It also had built-in woofer and surround-sound speakers that were powerful enough to be felt loud at 40% volume. 

After 14 years, it had started to produce a slightly blurred output. It was time to replace it. So, I went to the trusted local electronics shop and asked for a 32" TV with a reasonably good picture quality and a good set of built-in speakers. I was shown 6 different LED TVs. 

LED TVs are essentially, LCD TVs with LED based back-lighting, instead of lamps. This makes it possible for them to have a slim build and reduce power consumption by about 40%. In the lower price segment, there wasn't much of a difference in picture quality between LED and LCD TVs. I had done my homework. However, at the store, I was disappointed to learn that because of the slim body, LED TVs lack good speakers. In fact, they had terrible speakers for the price-segment I was looking at. At 100% volume, I had to stand within 30 inches to feel any loudness.

The store salesman commented that most people buy external speakers with LED TVs and recommended a speaker set. It was a Sunday evening and I didn't want to push the purchase to the next weekend. So, I bought a Panasonic LED TV and an additional speaker set. 

**Lesson #1 - Don't buy on impulse.**

**Lesson #2 - You are likely to be impulsive on a Sunday evening.**

Once the system was installed at my home, I realised that there was something off about the speakers compared to their sound at the store. It seemed like the sound was coming out of a cave. It was disconcerting. Perhaps, it had to do with how the speakers were placed. Also, the speaker set had its own volume control. Even when the TVs volume was at 0, the speakers amplified it! It was an inconvenience that me and my family would have to bear for the lifetime of the TV. 

**Lesson #3 - Don't compromise on your minimum requirements. They come from your past experiences.**

After a few phone calls, I was able to get through to the shop owner and convinced him to replace it with a model having acceptable built-in speakers. Thankfully, there was a Panasonic LCD TV, an older model they had in stock, that fulfilled my requirements and fit in my budget. 

**Lesson #4 - A product with the latest technology doesn't necessarily make it a better alternative.**

Those were three, highly stressful hours, when I made a big blunder and had to vehemently argue my case to make amends. I now realise that buying a TV is much more daunting for someone who reads specifications. Sometimes, all you need is a subjective view.
