Last weekend, when I sent my mac for repairs, I brought home a spare office laptop to setup a development environment for my work on [ERPNext] [1]. I tried a few Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Mint and Sabayon, before I found a mention of [Elementary OS] [2] in one of the comments of [this article][5].

It's website and screenshots clearly conveyed that the team had poured their hearts out to build it. Not only did I install Elementary OS on the spare laptop, but also replaced Ubuntu on my home computer and the rest of the office computers.

It is like OS X in many ways, but much snappier and has one of the most polished desktop managers found in Linux (I dislike [unity][3] and [gnome 3][4]). Also, it is built on top of Ubuntu core, so you can do anything that can be done on Ubuntu.

Surprisingly, I didn't find it in any of the best Linux distributions lists. I know it is in public beta, but at least a mention!

Here are some screenshots for you. (Click to enlarge)

In sum, for a PC, I would choose Elementary OS. It's just too good.

Combined with tools like [Sublime Text 2][7], [GIMP][8] and [Blender][9], I think I can do without Mac OS X.
