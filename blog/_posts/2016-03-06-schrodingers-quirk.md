title: "Schrödinger’s Quirk"
excerpt: A quirk is both a strength and a weakness
---

Today I had my first hangover. *“Could there be a way to have these fun evenings without the awful effects the next day?”*—I was immediately rebuked for uttering this blasphemous statement. You see, I have this little quirk of analyzing everything. It empowers me to do great work but prevents me from enjoying the mystique of a situation. A quirk is both a strength and a weakness; Only at the time of its expression does it collapse into one of the two. So, what would we be without our quirks? We would neither have strengths nor weaknesses. Does your pillow have strengths or weaknesses, or does it have pros and cons? Without quirks, we become lifeless, inhuman, reduced to the stature of objects. And that is what happens in many jobs that exist today, where you are expected to work with the efficiency a machine, assembling parts, churning out websites or converting those leads. We become resources and not workers. And I am happy that I am not a resource anymore. Five years back, I joined a team that appreciates such quirks. I am indebted to them for letting me be myself, acknowledging my weaknesses, hailing my strengths and helping me grow. So, I wish anyone who isn’t being quirky, to take a step back and then another.
