title: Impressions of a brand
excerpt: If you have used a product, you tend to have an opinion about it. That opinion is subconsciously carried over to the brand.

I was shopping for a pair of shoes for a trip to Yosemite. I needed them to be both durable and cozy, as the trek could take hours. But there were just too many options to choose from, many good ones, most going over budget. **I wanted to narrow down the options.** That’s when I asked my sister, which brand of shoes would she go for? “Sketchers! They are very comfortable.”

If you have used a product, you tend to have an opinion about it. **That opinion is subconsciously carried over to the brand.** It just takes one good or bad experience.

A relative of mine faced a lot of issues with an LG smartphone. Consequently, my family stopped buying LG products! From what I hear, LG makes many different products, at least some of which have very good reviews. But in this case, **one bad experience put the nail in the coffin for the whole brand.** 

On the other side, you have Apple vs Samsung. Some will stick to the Apple ecosystem despite Samsung offering counterparts with substantially more features and power for the buck. This is because Apple has a fanatic focus on design and user experience. Even if they have to tolerate the horrendous iTunes syncing, I have seen countless converts that keep talking about the awesomeness of Apple products and how they have the whole set of them. In this case, **the good experience put the brand on a pedestal.**

While such thoughts were churning in my mind, I tried to be mindful of the impressions the various brands gave off on my recent trip to the nearby premium outlets mall. GAP screamed affordability, Michael Kors: tasteful, Timberland oozed ruggedness and being close to nature, Godiva was the epitome of chocolate making, Columbia as mightier than weather, Adidas dramatizes sports. There were some brands that evoked mixed feelings or no impressions at all, like AT&amp;T, Calvin Klein, Coach, Reebok.

**I liked the clarity of purpose the former brands displayed** and I made purchases from those shops without second thoughts. That single and clear impression made the difference. 

Just like with humans, **people flock to brands with charisma.** Whether they started off with such a purpose or gradually eased into one, it certainly tipped the scales in their favour.

This got me to think what kind of vibes does ERPNext give off? We would appreciate your honest opinions.
