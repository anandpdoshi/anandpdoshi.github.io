Anita was scared. She was sitting among four men in a large white living room. The sofas were soft and clothed in plush leather. That should have made her sweat even more than usual, but the air conditioner was set to a low temperature and she was feeling rather cold instead. She just wanted to wrap it up and go home. 

It was 6 in the evening. The men facing her were in their mid forties, very wealthy and holding a glass of scotch. She always felt uncomfortable around alcohol. Why did she take up this job? It had taken a while to get placed via campus recruitment and she was delighted to land a job at the prestigious bank. After working a few weeks at IEGD bank, she found out that most women left the job after a year. As a relationship manager, she was required to go to rich clients' home and offer new investment opportunities which best fit their needs and most women felt unsafe doing it. Now she knew why.

The first time she had visited Mr. Suresh Fukrey's home, she was accompanied by Priya, a product manager. Priya was one of the few women who had decided to keep working at the bank after the first year. She was much more courageous than it looked. There was no one else at home but Mr. Fukrey and the housekeeper. His wife was in London, visiting her sister. She would be away for more than six months. They had two children, both studying in the United States. Anita presented the new liquid fund investment plans, while Priya elaborated on some points. Mr. Fukrey seemed less interested in the investment opportunity and more on Anita. She felt very uncomfortable. It was customary to leave your contact information with the client and it weighed on her when she did. 

They left and she felt relief wash over her. She had hoped she wouldn't need to come here again. After all, the client hadn't shown interest in the product. The next day, she received a call from him that he was interested in the plan and tried to coax her to present the same product to his friends too. She claimed she was busy this week and would request someone else to visit. But Mr. Fukrey was adamant that she be the one to present. She felt threatened and disconnected the call. She had hoped that Mr. Fukrey got the message. Yet, he called again and tried to talk her into coming. She disconnected the call again. He called her manager and escalated the issue, and so she was told that she should not be so rude to the clients. She felt cornered. She had to go or risk being frowned upon and not have a glorious recommendation when she exits the bank at the end of the year.

While she was elaborating on the market situation and how the fund managed risks, she was interrupted by Mr. Alok Johar. He was tall, probably 6 ft., sat besides Mr. Fukrey and had a relaxed aura about him. He didn't seem to be interested in investing either. She could see that on everyones face. Mr. Johar started asking how it was like working at the bank, then shifted to more personal questions like if she was married and what has she studied. How was that relevant? She needed to get out soon. 

She lied that she was indeed married, but didn't wear sindoor. She steered the conversation back to the topic, hurried with the forms and pamphlets, and gave them the phone number of Bharat Vyas, her colleague who was also a relationship manager and would handle further inquiries. Bharat had given her this idea and she hoped that they would not pursue the matter further. She thanked them and left hurriedly lest they start talking again.

She almost ran out of the building, caught the first rickshaw and only felt better once she was a mile away. She was confident that she had circumvented the situation and they would not contact her further. Gradually, she felt a smile coming on her face. She felt brave.
