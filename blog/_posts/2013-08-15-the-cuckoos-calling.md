The Cuckoo's Calling is a detective novel written by J. K. Rowling under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.

The story involves the fall to death of a supermodel Lula Lundry. Her brother, John Bristow, unable to accept the apparent suicide, hires C. B. Strike to dig deeper. Cormoran Strike was part of Special Investigative Branch of Royal Military Police, until he lost half a leg in a blast in Afghanistan. The story takes us along in his attempts, as a private detective, to uncover what the police might have missed. The method of investigation seems believable and practical, unlike in Sherlock Holmes, where the reader only gets to praise his genius in the end. As a private detective, Strike is able to extract seemingly unimportant details that the police discounted under pressure. He is also helped by a resourceful though temporary secretary, Robin Ellacott. 

The characters are detailed and distinct. The setting raises enough questions to keep the story shrouded in mystery. Especially the flow, which is expertly handled and compels the reader to forsake a few hours of sleep, just to reach that elusive turning point. However, just like any other mystery novel, it tries to shock the reader with an unexpected end, which I find to be anti-climactic. For once, I would've wanted the murderer to be out of the list of suspects. I think the best part of any mystery novel should be the journey, and this book certainly has an interesting one.

The book is very well written and has a natural flow to it, as you would expect from J. K. Rowling - not something a first-time writer could've achieved. I started this book hoping for a quick read, after being bogged down by reading a sizeable portion of 1Q84. And it doesn't disappoint. I eagerly await the next one in this series.
