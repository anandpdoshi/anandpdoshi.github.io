Yesterday, I experienced one of the most beautiful sights of nature on my way back to Mumbai from Pune.

It was my first time driving on the expressway. Our driver was shit scared riding shotgun. And to further increase his fear, nature decided to release its liquid load.

Welcome to a rainy ride on the expressway. The windscreen wipers running at max, blinking parking lights of the gliding cars, the spiral water jet released by their tyres and everything getting bathed in the cold shower. To add to this beautiful seen, the sun peeking from the clouds, then gradually coming out in the open to check out the beauty and to say joey's favourite line, "Hey, how you doin'?"

It was one of the most surreal experiences of my life. I wish I had a camera mounted on the dashboard, such that it takes pictures of the scene ahead and my expressions simultaneously. Maybe then you could get an inkling of the joy I felt.
