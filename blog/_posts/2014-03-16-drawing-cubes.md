It has been [2 weeks](/blog/drawing.html) since I last drew. The trial period of Mischief expired and I had to purchase its license. I was reluctant to part with the money because I was unsure if I would continue with this hobby. Also, it cost me more than my pen tablet!

Today's chapter was about drawing cubes. I started with a basic single cube, proceeded to 3 elaborate gift boxes, then on to an arrangement of 5 different sized cubes and eventually, the book asked me to draw a box I had, placed such that the top was foreshortened. The last exercise was very tiring and my hands are sore as I type. Here is the output of my effort. You can click on the image to view a larger version.
