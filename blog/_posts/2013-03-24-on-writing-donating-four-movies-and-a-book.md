title: On Writing, Donating, Four Movies And A Book

Writing good is hard. May be I am too focused on the good part. May be it is just about writing and the good comes when it wants to. May be that's the reason I find it difficult to write a blog.

This friday, I was checking out a wikipedia article when found a banner on the top, asking for donation. It is kind of sad that wikipedia needs to ask for it. I donated Rs. 500. Its a miserly amount, but it is a start for me. It is difficult to part with money when you have been raised to be spartan about your spending habits.

I also recalled the joy we felt when ERPNext got a donation due to our responses on the developer forum. In an ideal world, I would want to work for a non-profit. I admire Wikimedia and Mozilla Foundations. Though, working on an open source project comes quite close to it.

I saw Cloud Atlas, Looper, Moonrise Kingdom and Perks of being a wallflower. Mostly good movies. I am happy that Cloud Atlas and Moonrise Kingdom were able to get funds. Both were unconventional, the former convoluted, the latter funny and endearing. Looper, though predictable, made a good sci-fi flick and thankfully, was not ostentatious. Perks of being a wallflower could've been better or may be, I was just expecting more since I have read the book.

If you are into reading, you should not miss out on this book by Tina Selling - What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20. She is succinct and avoids being preachy. It is a book you can revisit every 5-10 years and you will find something you can apply in your life at that moment. 

Last week, I had attempted to write a blog about debit and credit in accounting, by taking some pointers from accounting history. However, it felt half-assed and incoherent. To develop further insight, I am going to delve into The Ascent of Money by Niall Ferguson. Hopefully, it will leave me enlightened about finance and accounting and clear up the fuzziness of credit and debit.

Have some time to kill - check out [Carnival Of Rust] [1], a song by Poets of the Fall.
