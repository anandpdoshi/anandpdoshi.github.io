<label>Summary</label>

Communication started with symbols or pictographs, but the need to express abstract concepts led to the development of language and writing. Today, writing is our primary mode of communication and the use of symbols and sketches is only an accessory. However, even today, we often need to use sketches to express some of our ideas.

Many of us stop sketching once we are done with high school, especially because in higher education, sketching is taught with an artistic goal. We stop using sketches for ideation and use writing instead. This often limits our creative capabilities. 

In this project, I aim to design a tool that helps you to continue learning how to sketch, with the aim to be good at expressing ideas, as a means of ideation and communication.

       <strong>Project Design Problem Statement</strong><br>
       <p>
           Communication started with symbols or pictographs: direct and easy to understand. It was the need to keep track of people, money and produce (abstract ideas) that led to the development of writing. Today, writing is our primary mode of communication and the use symbols is only an accessory. The saying, "A picture is worth a thousand words", has become a cliché.
       </p>
       <p>
           As an upcoming designer, I find it difficult to express the various ideas that form in my mind. When I try to sketch them out, they often come out as very different from what I visualized. Due to a busy schedule, I have tried to self-learn drawing in my free time, with the goal to use sketching as a means to express my ideas. Learning to draw is a lot about feedback: small but significant corrections that lead to better expression of the idea. However, most feedback I have received from people has been subjective. I wish there was a way to get quick objective feedback, preferably without asking humans.
       </p>
       <p>
           I believe I am not alone in this. So, I wish to design a tool that helps people who are learning to sketch on their own, primarily as a means for communication, and probably not for an artistic goal. It will be designed for ages 13 and up, speaking any language.
       </p>
       <p> 
           There are many websites and apps that teach you to draw. However, their goal is often artistic and focus on techniques: the how vs the what. The few apps that teach you to draw animals or objects, do so on a touch-screen device and are difficult to use. One source of inspiration for this project is the Noun Project, which is a big repository of symbols that depict entities or ideas. I always end up using the icons available there when making a visual representation for a project. This makes me want to be able to sketch like those icons when I am brainstorming or taking notes. SketchNotes is another source of inspiration. The tool I wish to design should help its users learn to express their thoughts graphically.
       </p>
       <p>          
           Sketching can make us better communicators and possibly lead to better ideas. A sketching app is also an interesting challenge in terms of interaction design and I would learn much more than interaction while designing it.

       <strong>Research & Comparative Analysis</strong><br>
       <p>
           In this phase, I started with asking "How do people learn to sketch?". Through online research, I narrowed down my options to books, websites, online courses, apps, coaching from a human being and via social networks. I compared these alternatives and prepared a list of pros and cons, which helped me build this bug-list that will be used to design the tool.

       <strong>Sketching - Phase 1</strong><br>
       
       <p>
           In this phase, I sketched 8 completely different ideas about what the tool could be.

       <strong>Sketching - Phase 2</strong><br>
       
       <p>
           After phase 1, I received feedback from our instructor that some of my concepts like #4 and #6 were not unique enough. In this next step, I was asked to expand on these concepts, by sketching a 5 slide storyboard for each, and also come up with 2 new ideas to replace #4: Play when I say and #6: Make it so.

       <strong>Personas</strong><br>
       
       <p>
          The next step was to build 3 personas and an anti-persona based on the target users. Due to time constraints, we were asked to come up with personas without interview or survey data. I based my personas on people I knew and profiles of reddit users.

       <strong>Story Map</strong><br>
       
       <p>
           This involved creating a set of tasks and a narrative flow for how the application will be used by the primary persona, as well as the variations based on secondary ones. Through this process, I realized that the application should have the ability to be used during short breaks. I came back to this insight later during the final prototype.

       <strong>Questions, Options and Constraints (QOC)</strong><br>
       
       <p>
           In this uncommon step, I used the sketches, personas and story map as the base for considering the design of one critical feature and 3 different approaches to this feature. This was helpful in thinking about the details of the feature, but most of these ideas were discarded at the paper prototype and digital prototype stages, because of the feedback I received from my peer group.

       <strong>Paper Prototype</strong><br>
       
       <p>
           This was a fun assignment, that pushed me to give form to the ideas in my mind. The draft paper prototype was critiqued by my peer group, and based on their feedback, I created the final paper prototype. I discarded the idea of having a multi-player sketching game, and changed it to single player, with personal goals and leaderboard.

       <strong>Digital Prototype</strong><br>
       
       <p>
           In the high-fidelity digital prototype, I incorporated the feedback I received during the paper prototype stage, and used a 'sketch' like aesthetics for its visual design. I envisioned it to be used on touch screen devices, and the design to be OS agnostic, similar to how games are designed on mobile and tablet platforms. Due to time constrains, I was only able to create one interaction for mobile form factor.
