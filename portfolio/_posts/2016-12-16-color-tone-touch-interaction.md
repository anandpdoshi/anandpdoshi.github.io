This paper explores the use of touch gestures to interact with colors on a screen by producing sound based on hue, saturation and value of a pixel.

A speech mode also announces the color at the touch-point, thus making it not only an interesting instrument, but also a tool for the visually impaired. <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29814148/toughspirit-blog-files/portfolio/umsi/SI515/color-tone.pdf" target="_blank">Read Full Report</a>
