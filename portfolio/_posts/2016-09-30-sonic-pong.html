        Sound Pong is a simple game in which a player uses a ping pong paddle to bounce the ball in the air and aims to get the highest score for the number of times the ball bounced on the paddle. It uses a mic, attached to the base of the paddle, to capture the audio signal. A <a href="https://cycling74.com/products/max/" target='_blank'>Max</a> patch is then used to detect the peaks in the audio (acoustic tracking) and increment a counter. Once the player loses control of the ball, the counter can be reset by blowing air into the mic. <a href="/assets/others/toughspirit-blog-files/portfolio/umsi/SI515/Acoustic%20Tracking.pdf" target="_blank">Read Full Report</a>
