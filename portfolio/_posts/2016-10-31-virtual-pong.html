            Game controllers have evolved over the years from ergonomic buttoned remote controllers to rods with inertial sensors (PlayStation / Wii). Some gaming consoles like the Xbox 360 use Kinect to track movement using video and depth perception, without any physical controller. However, these use specialized hardware and work only with their corresponding consoles. With the use of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), one could potentially convert everyday physical objects into gaming controllers, that could potentially be platform independent. Such controllers take advantage of known affordances of various objects to control suitable actions in a game and provide a richer experience to the user. This is demonstrated here by using a ping pong paddle as a controller for a virtual game of pong. <a href="/assets/others/toughspirit-blog-files/portfolio/umsi/SI515/Inertial%20Tracking.pdf" target="_blank">Read Full Report</a>
