            <strong>Communication started with symbols or pictographs: direct and easy to understand.</strong> It was the need to keep track of people, money and produce (abstract ideas) that led to the development of writing. Today, writing is our primary mode of communication and the use symbols is only an accessory. However, even today, we often need to use sketches to express some of our ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many of us stop sketching once we are done with high school, especially because in higher education, sketching is taught with an artistic goal. We stop using sketches for ideation and use writing instead. This often limits our creative capabilities.

        <h4>My Role</h4>
        <p>
            This was a semester long solo project as part of the Introduction to Interaction Design course. Throughout the project, I read books about sketching, tried every sketching app I could get my hands on, and tried to sketch as much as I could. Out of the various steps in the design process, I learned the most from iterating on the paper prototype and the digital one.

        <h4>Research &amp; Comparative Analysis</h4>

        <p>
            <strong>How do people learn to sketch?</strong> Through online research, I narrowed down my options to books, websites, online courses, apps, coaching from a human being and via social networks. I compared these alternatives and prepared a list of pros and cons, which helped me build this bug-list.

This helped me understand how the application will be used, and possible variations depending on circumstances. Through this process, <strong>I realized that the application should have the ability to be used during short breaks.</strong> I came back to this insight later during the final prototype.
