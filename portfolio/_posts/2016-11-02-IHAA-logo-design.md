excerpt: The process of designing a logo for International House, Ann Arbor

The client wished for an abstract logo for International House, Ann Arbor, because they were not certain about the name yet. 

**About the organization**    
The IHAA is an intentional international intercultural, interspiritual, living learning community for students and visiting scholars from around the world.

IHAA seeks to be a community of respect and friendship in which persons from many different countries, cultures, religions, political perspectives, and vocational interests may learn from one another through residential living, educational programming, and social interactions.

**The design process**    
After the initial sketching phase, 3 ideas were shortlisted and developed further into initial logos.
