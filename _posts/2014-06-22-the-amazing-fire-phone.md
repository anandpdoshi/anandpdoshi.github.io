*Anand, are you going to Rakesh’s home?*

Yeah. I am. What about it?

*Tomorrow is his daughter’s birthday. Do you want to buy a gift for her?*

Erm. Yes. But I have almost reached his home.

*Jenga Blocks is still in his wish list. None of his known associates has bought it recently. If you place the order now, you can collect it right now from the Amazing Store, 500 meters away from his home. It will cost ₹ 700. Should I place the order?*

Okay! Go ahead.

*Your order will be gift wrapped and ready for pickup in 10 minutes. Also, it has been removed from Rakesh’s wish list.*

*I have set the navigation destination to Amazing Store. You will reach there in 12 minutes.*

Thanks Firi.

**Just another day in the future.**
